# (ICLR 2024) Explaining Time Series via Contrastive and Locally Sparse Perturbations (ContraLSP)

Code for **Explaining Time Series via Contrastive and Locally Sparse Perturbations** accepted by ICLR 2024. ContraLSP is implemented in PyTorch and tested on different time series tasks, including classification and prediction benchmarks. Our experiments are based on [time_interpret](https://github.com/josephenguehard/time_interpret), and thanks to the all original authors!

## Introduction

We posted an introductory presentation on this [[slides]](https://github.com/zichuan-liu/ContraLSP/blob/main/intro_contralsp_slides.pdf), so you can get a quick overview of the work.

## Installation instructions

```shell script
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
The requirements.txt file can be used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment.

## Run our toy data

```shell script
cd ContraLSP
python demo.py
```
This is a test explaining a simple white-box regression model, in which you can see a comparison of three different masks (including dynamask, nnmask, and ours).

## Reproducing experiments

All of our experiments can be reproduced by following the instructions.

**Go to the relevant dataset directory (rare/hmm/switchstate/mortalty) and execute python main.py**, e.g.:

run the diffgroup rare feature dataset:
```shell script
cd rare
python rare_feature_diffgroup.py --print_result False
```
and then test it and print results:
```
python rare_feature_diffgroup.py --print_result True
```

All results will be stored in the `save_dir` folder.
